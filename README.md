I made this project because the platform that I use to purchase stocks has the functionality to purchase a fraction
of a share in a limit order and I would manually compute the fraction of shares that I would need to purchase a 
specific dollar amount of stock at a specific price based on a certain percentage point up or down that I desired for 
the order. I made this program to create a general solution that would compute the specific number of shares for 
the percentages in the limit order that I desired for me.
